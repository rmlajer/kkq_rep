This life cycle stage includes all emissions from agriculture including upstream emissions from the
production of fertiliser, chemicals, fuels, machinery, buildings, services as well as transport of these
inputs to agriculture. Further, the substituted productions caused by by-products are included. This
refers to e.g. beef (cows, heifers and bulls) from milk cattle, and wool from sheep.'),

fertiliser cause production of fertiliser. The following activities use land: crops, animal grassing,
forestry, urban area, infrastructure and mining. When an activity use land, this cause expansion of
human activities into wild nature as well as intensification of existing productive land (yield
increases).'),

activities except agriculture and iLUC: the production of fuels, chemicals, machinery, buildings,
services, transport of non-feedstock inputs (transport of agricultural products to food processing is
included under the life cycle stage ‘transport’) and treatment of materials for treatment. The latter
includes treatment of wastes as well as processing of residues to animal feed and other byproducts, e.g. in the rendering industry. The substituted productions caused by by-products are
included.'),

downstream emissions from end-of-life treatment of the materials. When the end-of-life includes
by-products such as recovered energy from waste incineration and materials from recycling/reuse,
the substituted production of heat, electricity and virgin materials are included.'),
